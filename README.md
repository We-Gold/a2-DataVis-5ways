## Matplotlib / Seaborn

Notes:
- The colors are not exactly the same as the original due to differences in default color palettes between ggplot2 and Seaborn. I tried to match purple manually since it was the most different.
- The legend is clearly different in style. I placed it to the right side so it is similar to the original. 
- The legend uses greater granularity for the sizes.
- I had to add some custom code to get the point outlines to match their fill instead of being white.

## R + ggplot2

Notes:
- Since the original graphic was created with ggplot2, the R + ggplot2 version is nearly identical to the original.
